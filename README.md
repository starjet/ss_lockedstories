Get a list of Starlight Stage stories that are available to you but locked due to insufficient fan count.

This was created because Chihiro-sama is being very uncooperative when it comes to finding out which idols I need to raise the fan count for to unlock more commus.
Chihiro-sama is a great, beautiful and benevolent goddess and I love her voice but I will break something if I have to listen to one more "aidoru no minna to communication wo torimashou". Please forgive me, Chihiro-sama.
